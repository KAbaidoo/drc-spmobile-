    <string name="consent_agreement">The Government of the Republic through the Ministry of  Social Affairs (MINAS) has embarked on a series of reforms of the social protection sector for effective piloting.
        The purpose of this reform is to broaden the database of poor and vulnerable persons in MINAS to include those of actors implementing social assistance programmes,
        including agencies of the United Nations system and national and international NGOs, and to allow the control of personal data, according to a protocol to be agreed.
        Ultimately, the process will lead to the construction of a Social Register serving as a gateway for the registration and eligibility of vulnerable people and households for several programmes in social assistance.
        It is for this purpose that your consent is requested to provide us with the information contained in this questionnaire in order to enable the Government to improve its social policies.
        Thank you for giving us a part from your time and we guarantee the confidential nature of the data collected as a result of this survey, in accordance with Decree No. 10/05 of 11 February on the National Statistical System."
