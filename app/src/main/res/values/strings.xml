    <string name="consent_agreement">The Government of the Republic through the Ministry of Social Affairs (MINAS) has embarked on a series of reforms of the social protection sector for effective management. The present reform aims to broaden the MINAS database of poor and vulnerable people to those of agencies involved in implementing social assistance programs, including agencies of the United Nations System and national and international NGOs, and to allow control of personal data, according to a protocol to be agreed. Ultimately, the process will result in the construction of a Social Register serving as a gateway for the registration and eligibility of vulnerable persons and households for several social assistance programs. It is for this purpose that your consent is requested to provide us with the information contained in this questionnaire in order to enable the Government to improve its social policies. Thank you for giving us part of your time and we guarantee the confidential nature of the data collected as a result of this survey, in accordance with Decree No. 10/05 of February 11 relating to the National Statistical System.</string>
